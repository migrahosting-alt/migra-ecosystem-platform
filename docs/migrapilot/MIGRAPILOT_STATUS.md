# MigraPilot — Master Status

**`MIGRAPILOT_STATUS.json` is canonical.** This page is the human-readable summary of it.
Both are updated together, on every material change.

Why this exists: work kept discovering something, moving three lanes away, and then having to
reconstruct what was finished — or why a decision was made — from conversation history. Every agent
(Claude, Engineer, MigraPilot) reads this instead.

> ⚠️ `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are **gitignored** in this repository, so the pointers added there are
> local only. This file and its JSON are the tracked copies — link to `docs/migrapilot/` from any new
> instruction file rather than relying on a root-level one to travel.

## Standing rules

| Rule | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Easy first** | Do not start deep capability work while meaningful easy user-facing items remain. |
| **PROVEN_LIVE** | Requires the real user-facing workflow to pass. Code existing and tests passing is **not** proof. |
| **Acceptance gate** | The app's own test command **+ `tsc -b` + live browser**. A pre-commit hook is not the acceptance suite. |
| **Cost discipline** | owned → open-source → self-hosted → free tier → partner credits → paid. Nothing recurring enters quietly. |
| **Honest unavailable** | A capability that is not ready refuses truthfully rather than appearing to work. |

## Active lane — Files & Documents

**Objective:** finish common file/document behaviour before deeper capabilities.

**Last proven milestone:** all five common formats (TXT, MD, CSV, JSON, code) grounded live;
historical file cards render immediately *and* after reload; deleting a file preserves history and
stops grounding.

**Live:** consumer `citations-bc990598` · brain `citations-bc990598`

🚨 **BLOCKED — GPU VRAM contention, not a fault.** ComfyUI holds ~21.5 GB of the workstation's 24 GB
RTX 3090, leaving ~3 GB. `qwen3:8b` needs ~6 GB and fails with HTTP 500 after ~5 minutes; a 1.5 B model
still works. **MigraPilot chat and MigraPilot image generation contend for the same card** — this is an
owner decision about GPU sharing, not something to fix in code.
**Rollback:** consumer `filecard2-` → `filecard-` → `docrefusal-` → `refusalpersist-` → `bc99059`

**Next acceptance test:** citation consistency across TXT/MD/CSV/JSON/code — is the missing citation
on Markdown model variance or a deterministic presentation bug?

**Not yet:** PDF/DOCX extraction · Live Source Intelligence · any search vendor · deleting local
media fallback copies.

## Capability status

**PROVEN_LIVE** — Media Library · canonical object-storage media writes · Helsinki replica ·
media monitoring/ILM/restore · image generation persistence · deterministic glyphs · conversation
rename · anonymous→authenticated continuity · image attachment history · follow-up image context ·
image-context isolation · truthful image-editing refusal · refusal persistence + telemetry ·
TXT/MD/CSV/JSON/code grounding · historical file cards · truthful "no document attached" refusal ·
deletion preserves history

**STABILIZATION** — MediaStorage local fallback: **7 clean days required**, started 2026-08-26.
🚨 Run `migra-media-faultwindow open` before testing an alert, or a deliberate fault resets the window.

**PAUSED_CHECKPOINTED** — Live Source Intelligence. Foundation, qualification battery, vendor legal
review and source-family map are done. Resume **only** after this lane is stable, and resume with
the free/direct-source investigation — **not** with paid provider integration.

**HONESTLY_UNAVAILABLE** — PDF · DOCX/XLSX/PPTX · ZIP · existing-image editing · general web search ·
deep research · agents · scheduled automation · full Projects.

**SECURITY_HARDENING** — separate Hetzner project for DR credential isolation. Needs a console action
from Bonex. **Not a product blocker.**

## Open defects

| Defect | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Citation shown for TXT, absent for Markdown | MEDIUM | **Fixed** — attribution now comes from the engine, not the prose. Needs live proof. |
| `qwen3:8b` fails while ComfyUI holds the GPU | EASY to unblock | Blocks live acceptance; stopping ComfyUI disables image generation |
| Vision turn held 240s and returned nothing | MEDIUM | Operational target, not reproducible |

## Drift control — conclusions that were overturned

Kept so they are not re-derived, and so the pattern stays visible.

- **MinIO on the OS disk** → wrong; it has a dedicated 200 GB volume. I measured `/` instead of its configured volume.
- **No off-host backup** → wrong; a daily encrypted restic backup to Hetzner already existed, with a weekly restore drill.
- **Follow-up image context broken** → wrong; the trace said `dropped:1` because I had deleted that artifact minutes earlier.
- **PDF rejection is a bug** → wrong; it is a deliberate refusal, and the work is building extraction.
- **Weekly backups / SQLite in production / green hook means green build** → all wrong, all corrected.

The recurring shape: **a narrow, explained failure inflated into a broad claim about the architecture.**
Read the telemetry that separates *attempted* from *delivered* before concluding a capability is missing.

## Backlog

**Easy / next** — citation consistency.

**Medium** — PDF extraction (⚠️ verify runtime/library compatibility on VM111 first; "pure-JS required"
is an **unverified** assumption) · DOCX · XLSX/PPTX · ZIP · bounded vision timeout.

**Deep** — Live Source Intelligence · image editing · connected apps · scheduled tasks · Projects ·
agents · deep research.

---

## Cost

**No recurring paid dependency is in the architecture.** Hetzner Object Storage is already owned and
in use. All six retrieval vendors are `needs_approval`; none has credentials.
